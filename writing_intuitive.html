            <p>Last week I attended an event hosted by my local UXPA chapter (Front Range UXPA) titled “8 STEPS TO AN INTUITIVE UI”. 
                The talk was presented by Everett McKay, author of <a class="blue" target="_blank" aria-label="Opens in new tab"
                href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Intuitive_Design.html?id=QcsetAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description">
                    Intuitive Design: Eight Steps to an Intuitive UI</a>, wherein he 
                introduces a framework of straight-forward principles used to achieve intuitiveness in a UI.</p>
            
            <p>Before delving into the details, he advocated that we always first define what an “intuitive UI” is so then we could 
                work towards achieving it:</p>

            <blockquote>A UI is intuitive when target users understand its behavior and effect without use of reason, memorization, 
                experimentation, documentation, or training. (Everett McKay, 2019)</blockquote>
            
            <p>McKay argues that today's users expect to understand software intuitively, without relying on training or documentation. 
                No longer are users satisfied with reading user manuals to figure out how to get their jobs done on computers.</p>
            
            <p>Now that we've defined what it is to have an intuitive UI, how do we work towards achieving it? According to Everett 
                McKay, we should evaluate a UI using the following principles:</p>

            <ol class="h3">
                <li>
                    <h3>Discoverability</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: User is looking to search and finds the search box.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Affordance</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: A button looks clickable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Comprehensibility</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: A save button is labeled something like “Save”.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Response Feedback</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: User clicks on a button and the application provides immediate feedback.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Predictability</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: The application shows presents the next UI in a process after the user clicks on “next” button.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: The user only had to click on one button to save.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Forgiveness</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: The user can easily “undo” a mistake they did.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Explorability</h3>
                    <p class="example">Example: The user feels confident they can “click around” without getting lost.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Using these principles, we can then go through the process of making a UI intuitive, but that begs the question: how intuitive? 
                Here are the levels of intuitiveness defined by Mr. McKay:</p>
            <img src="images/Intuitive-UI---levels.png" />
            
            <p>Finally, we can go through the process of improving the UI:</p>
            <img src="images/Intuitive-UI---process.png" />

            <p>I hope some teams adopt this process to help make their apps more intuitive. I recommend buying Everett's book and attending 
                one of his talks. He's been around the nation since last year, so if you're interested hopefully you'll find an event near 
                you. Here are links for reference:</p>
