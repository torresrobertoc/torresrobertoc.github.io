        <p>The most frustrating online experiences don't stem from clashing color schemes 
            or overly verbose text, but instead from unfriendly or “unusable” form validations, 
            notoriously from public sector websites and online banking. The validation of data 
            is an essential part of software engineering yet prior to development, validation 
            is rarely given more than a cursory glance, a mention, or worse yet - assumed to 
            be implemented without further discussion.</p>
        
        <p>Error messages and notifications occur during moments that we have a user's most-focused
            attention. From a user's perspective, they're in the middle of completing one of many
            tasks. They expect to see confirmation of an action (like submitting/saving) when 
            instead they are prompted with errors they didn't know existed. Right-away users start
             feeling frustrated as they start trying to figure-out what they missed. As a user does
              this, they are even more focused on the screen than they were a minute ago because 
              they're trying to reconcile their expectations with what actually occurred. It is at 
              this moment that the user is most “connected” to the software. We should embrace these
               moments of “connection” and seize them as ways to make the best impression on the 
               user. If we expect users to love our software, then when problems occur (like invalid
                or missing data) we should be willing to do some “hand-holding” to get them through 
                what could be a frustrating experience.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some tips for giving a best impression when validating form data:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Make error messages clearly visible by...</h3>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>... not just relying on color
                  <ul class="no-dots">
                    <li class="avoid italic">Red text doesn't always work for color-blind users.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>... using proximity
                    <ul class="no-dots">
                      <li class="check italic">Show the message close to the related field.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>... adding an indicator
                    <ul class="no-dots">
                        <li class="check italic">E.g. an exclamation-marked triangle icon.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make it easy for the user to correct the problem</h3>
              <ol type="A" class="no-dots">
                <li class="avoid">Don't reset the form (blank-out fields) so users can fix typos instead of re-entering data.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Use clear, friendly language when communicating</h3>
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Avoid accusatory language
                        <ul class="no-dots">
                            <li class="avoid italic">“You did it wrong”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid vague or obvious messages
                        <ul class="no-dots">
                            <li class="avoid italic">“Something went wrong”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Explain why the data is wrong
                        <ul class="no-dots">
                            <li class="check italic">“Email addresses should contain a '@'”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Don't display technical errors (a.k.a. exceptions)</h3>
                <ol class="no-dots">
                    <li class="avoid italic">“System.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.”</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>We have the ability to make that moment the most frustrating interaction or the most pleasant 
            by how we execute the validation and communicate the errors to the user. Do you agree? Have 
            you thought about how error messages can affect a user's mood? Do you have any tips you'd like 
            to share?</p>
