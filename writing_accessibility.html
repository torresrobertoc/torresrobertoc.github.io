        <main>
            <p>Accessibility is often overlooked. In general terms, making 
                your website/ application more accessible means you're making it easier 
                for people with disabilities to use your product. The problem is that most 
                projects lack clear accessibility objectives. This means that either 
                stakeholders don't think it's important or they're lacking the knowledge to 
                define accessibility policies. My goal for this post is to provide education 
                about accessibility and to provide arguments for including accessibility 
                into all project plans.</p>
            
            <p>To start with, accessibility is important for every project. If you say, 
                “Well, we don't have to worry about accessibility for our project because 
                most of our users don't have disabilities,” that is analogous to saying we 
                shouldn't have handicap parking spaces, wheelchair ramps, or bathroom 
                handicap stalls because most people don't have disabilities. Obviously, we 
                have decided as a society to make many accommodations for people with 
                disabilities in the real world. If we can agree that the idea of denying 
                people with disabilities accommodations in the real world is deplorable, 
                why would we deny our users the same courtesy in our software?</p>
            
            <p>Some might argue that there is a big difference between the difficulties that 
                people with disabilities face in the real-world versus what users with 
                disabilities face on the web. I would counter that point by arguing that the
                web has become so essential in this Information Age that the differences 
                between access in the real world and access in the virtual world are 
                becoming negligible. As a matter of fact, according to The New York Times, 
                <a class="blue" 
                    target="_blank" 
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-appeals-court-ruling.html?_r=1" 
                    aria-label="Opens in new tab">
                a federal court has recently decided that broadband internet should be 
                considered a utility</a> on par with telephone and electricity. Like it or not, 
                all signs point to users expecting higher accessibility standards from 
                their software products as well as increased accessibility regulations 
                being enforced by governing bodies.</p>
            
            <p>That being said, it's important to realize that any effort put into 
                implementing accessibility is not wasted on the majority of users. On the 
                contrary, implementing good accessibility practices into your project 
                improves usability for all. For instance, many users might be affected 
                by stress, fatigue, or environmental distractions as part of their normal, 
                daily work activities which may diminish their cognitive and physical 
                abilities. Have you ever visited a website after a long day and found 
                yourself needing to squint or move closer just to read the text? If more 
                websites implemented some basic accessibility practices, everyone's overall
                productivity would increase.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, time, expense, and effort are not valid excuses for neglecting 
                accessibility policies. Just as software aspects like security, branding, 
                and integrations have varying levels of implementation, accessibility can 
                also be implemented in different degrees. Keep in mind that a minimum 
                accessibility policy is far better than a complete lack of any accessibility 
                policies.</p>
            
            <p>So, who cares about Accessibility? We all should.</p>
