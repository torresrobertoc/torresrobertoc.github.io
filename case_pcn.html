                <h4>TL;DR</h4>
                I led the UX design for the Bankruptcy Payment Change Notification (PCN) project,
                the second application built on our new Single-Page Architecture. Working closely
                with product managers and SMEs, my work helped ship the application under tight constraints,
                improve usability and efficiency for servicers, and build trust in UX processes. This project,
                built specifically for Wells Fargo, marked the first full adoption of the HTML/CSS-based Atomic
                Design System I helped build and helped establish the application as part of Black Knight's core
                product suite.

            <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
            <h3>Designing a Brand-New Application with High Stakes</h3>

            <h4>Context:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bankruptcy regulations required servicers to notify courts and borrowers of loan payment changes.
                </li>
                <li>This process was previously handled manually or with outdated tools, increasing risk of
                    noncompliance.</li>
                <li>PCN was the first UI designed for the new Bankruptcy module, requiring a full front-end from
                    scratch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Constraints:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Had only 1 week on-site with SMEs to design the first set of screens.</li>
                <li>No direct user interviews were permitted at first due to a product culture where PMs owned user
                    communication.
                    I had to build trust, demonstrate value, and gradually shift this mindset.</li>
                <li>Complex workflows and terminology unfamiliar to most team members.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>I was the <strong>sole UX Designer</strong> assigned to the PCN project and collaborated closely with
                product managers, BAs, and developers. This project became a turning point in demonstrating UX's value
                in the division.</p>
            <ol class="h3">
                <li>
                    <h3>Rapid UX Discovery</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collaborated closely with SMEs and PMs during an on-site design sprint in Jacksonville, FL.
                        </li>
                        <li>Built instant credibility by quickly mapping real workflows and terminology.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Design & Prototyping</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created wireframes in Balsamiq to rapidly explore concepts and validate flows.</li>
                        <li>Presented designs early and often to PMs, devs, and SMEs to gather feedback.</li>
                        <li>Refined UI patterns based on mental models and data flow, especially around key timelines
                            and filing requirements.</li>
                        <p class="subtle">Early wireframe created in Balsamiq to align team on PCN workflow design.</p>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Developer Collaboration</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provided CSS code and guidance for implementing UI behavior, including form validation and
                            data visibility logic.</li>
                        <li>Held regular check-ins with front-end engineers to ensure high-fidelity implementation
                            matched the design intent.</li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Design Fix: From Developer Build to Final Implementation</h4>
                            <p>After the initial build, I stepped in to refine the layout and styling. The development team had
                                implemented core functionality, but the UI lacked proper spacing, visual hierarchy, and
                                alignment. I updated the CSS and markup to improve usability and match the design system's
                                standards.</p>

                        <li>Overcame cultural resistance to UX by showing how research and design improved outcomes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Won support from influential product leaders who later championed UX on future projects.
                        </li>
                        <li>Although we couldn't speak directly to external users, I validated flows with internal SMEs
                            who had domain knowledge from daily customer interactions.</li>

            <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <h3>A Focused UI for Complex Regulatory Workflows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task-Oriented Design:</strong> Each screen aligned to real-world workflows for payment
                    change tracking and legal filing.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalable Design:</strong> Used modular components from the design system to streamline
                    development.</li>
                <li><strong>Workflow Clarity:</strong> Grouped related data fields and used progressive disclosure to
                    manage complexity.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Confidence:</strong> UI design aligned with legal constraints, ensuring critical
                    data was surfaced properly.</li>

            <h2>Lessons Learned & Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constraints inspire focus:</strong> Time pressure and access limitations pushed me to rely
                    on strong patterns and rapid feedback loops.</li>
                <li><strong>Design systems pay off:</strong> Having a library of tested components enabled faster
                    delivery with fewer mistakes.</li>
                <li><strong>Embedded UX = speed + trust:</strong> Being in the room, asking the right questions,
                    and rapidly iterating with devs/PMs built trust and delivered results.</li>
                <li><strong>Culture change is possible:</strong> This project helped open the door for greater UX collaboration 
                    across future projects, including <a href="case_designsystem.html" class="blue">Atomic Design System</a> workstreams.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="case-study-callout">
                <p>This project shifted PM mindsets from "we don't need UX" to "let's involve UX early." 
                    That shift increased UX buy-in across the org.</p>
