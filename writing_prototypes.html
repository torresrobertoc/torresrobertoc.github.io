        <main>
            <p>Wireframes, prototypes, mockups… when someone uses one of these terms we pretty much know what they're 
                talking about - it's some sort of visual model or representation that conveys ideas/concepts for what 
                will eventually be built, like a sketch or blueprint. The problem lies in the fact that these terms 
                are often used interchangeably to describe different things, which may leave team members with unclear 
                expectations and confusing conversations. So, what do each of these terms actually describe?</p>
            
            <p>For the sake of argument, let's refer to wireframes, prototypes and mockups as descriptors for different 
                types of “representations”. Representations are classified based on varying degrees of two (2) dimensions:</p>
            <ul class="h3">
                <li>
                    <h3>Fidelity:</h3>
                    <span class="definition">the degree of exactness with which something is copied or reproduced.</span>
                    <ul class="no-dots">
                        <li class="example">Example: In the music world, audiophiles use the term “High Fidelity” to mean high-quality, 
                            rich reproduction of sound like that of a CD compared to the “Low Fidelity” of a cassette tape. 
                            Similarly, we can describe how visually close these representations are to the final product.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Interactivity:</h3>
                    <span class="definition">the degree of which the representation can respond to user actions.</span>
                    <ul class="no-dots">
                        <li class="example">Example: One end of the spectrum of interactivity is the fully built software/website that 
                            responds fully to commands/inputs given by the user, while at the other end is a napkin with 
                            a drawing on it. (If you ever worked for a small software shop or worked with spontaneous 
                            idea-makers you should be familiar with the “napkin spec”.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If we assume only two degrees (“low” and “high”) within each dimension (“fidelity” and “interactivity”) we come up with
                four (4) combinations in which we can classify representations:</p>
            <ol class="plain">
                <li class="definition">Low Fidelity & Low Interactivity</li>
                <li class="definition">High Fidelity & Low Interactivity</li>
                <li class="definition">Low Fidelity & High Interactivity</li>
                <li class="definition">High Fidelity & High Interactivity</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Now, we can categorize representations that share similar degrees of each dimension, specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Low Interactivity</span> pairs (#1 & #2 above) are categorized as <span class="bold">"mockups"</span> or <span class="bold">"static"</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold">High Interactivity</span> pairs (#3 & #4 above) are categorized as <span class="bold">"prototypes"</span></li>
                <li><span class="bold">High Fidelity</span> pairs (#2 & #4 above) are referred to as <span class="bold">"pixel-perfect"</span></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Additionally, each specific combination has its own term:</p>
            <ol class="plain">
                <li class="definition">
                    Low Fidelity, Low Interactivity =>  <span class="bold">"Wireframe"</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A basic, sketch-type drawing with no interactivity, mainly used to represent general layouts and design elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="definition">
                    High Fidelity, Low Interactivity => <span class="bold">"Design Flat"</span> or <span class="bold">"Visual Mockup"</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A highly accurate, visual representation of what a final product will look like with no interactivity, mainly used to convey look, feel and branding concepts.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="definition">
                    Low-Fidelity, High Interactivity => <span class="bold">"Low Fidelity Prototype"</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A basic, low-colored prototype that focuses on conveying user interactions rather than “look & feel”.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="definition">
                    High-Fidelity, High Interactivity => <span class="bold">"Pixel-Perfect Prototype"</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An almost exact representation of a final, alpha-version product (at least from a front-end development perspective).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>And of course there are always exceptions to the rule...</p>
            <ul class="h3">
                <li><h3>Paper Prototype:</h3>
                    <span class="definition">a hand-drawn low-fidelity, low-interactivity mockup used to quickly convey ideas to users. Often used for initial-state user-testing.
                </li>
                <li><h3>Clickable Wireframe:</h3>
                    <span class="definition">a low fidelity, somewhat interactive representation.  In terms of interactivity, this representation is a step lower than a "Low Fidelity Prototype".</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's about it! I hope this helps clarify what these terms really mean so we can focus on more productive conversations.</p>

            <p>Did I miss anything? Are there other terms you feel are often misused? Leave a comment or drop me a note.</p>
