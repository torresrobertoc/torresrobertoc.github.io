                <h4>TL;DR</h4>
                I led the UX strategy for Rincon, a next-gen mortgage servicing platform. My work helped reduce
                training time by 80%, improve usability, and modernize the UI as we transitioned away from Visual
                FoxPro. The platform's UI redesign and improved user experience played a key role in DRI's acquisition
                by ServiceLink.

            <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
            <h3>Modernizing a Legacy System</h3>

            <h4>Context:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The existing platform was built in Visual FoxPro and couldn't meet client demands for scalability or
                    usability.</li>
                <li>There were no dedicated UX resources—developers were designing the UI themselves.</li>
                <li>Training and onboarding were time-consuming due to confusing layouts and terminology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Constraints:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Needed to redesign while preserving complex business workflows and terminology.</li>
                <li>Limited access to real users early on—we relied on internal SMEs and field interviews.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>I was a core contributor in the redesign of Rincon, working across UX, visual design, and front-end
                development. I introduced user-centered design practices, built a design system in XAML, and guided the
                project from research to implementation.</p>
            <ol class="h3">
                <li>
                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted on-site interviews with loan specialists and operations managers using the VFP platform.</li>
                        <li>Performed contextual inquiries to uncover workflow pain points.</li>
                        <li>Identified inconsistencies in terminology, layout, and field prioritization.</li>
                        <li>After the first client install, I again conducted a series of contextual interviews 
                            and generated a report that laid the foundation for the product roadmap:

                <li>
                    <h3>UI Design & Prototyping</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created wireframes and mockups for new workflows.</li>
                        <li>Redesigned information architecture to reduce cognitive load.</li>
                        <li>Delivered clickable prototypes for usability testing and stakeholder reviews.</li>

                        <p>Here are a few selected screens from the Rincon redesign (later Fusion), showing the 
                        transition from legacy UIs to the redesigned interface. These views reflect my role 
                        in improving usability, visual hierarchy, and layout consistency.</p>

                    <h3>XAML UI Component Development</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defined and documented reusable components (e.g., form layouts, buttons, navigation).</li>
                        <li>Collaborated with the dev team to implement a scalable XAML-based UI pattern library.</li>
                        <li>Created developer guides, design principles, and implementation training materials.</li>
                        <li>This early XAML component work laid the foundation for the HTML/CSS-based Design System</a>
                            I later created for LoanSphere's modernized UI.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Scaling the System Post-Acquisition</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After I left DRI in 2011, it was acquired by ServiceLink and the Rincon platform was rebranded as
                            <em>Fusion</em>. I was later recruited back as <strong>Sr. UI Engineer</strong> to 
                            formalize and scale the design system I had initiated.
                        </li>

                        <li>To scale the system across a much larger team, I created:

                    <p>The reusable XAML components, patterns, and documentation I created for Rincon laid the
                        groundwork

            <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <h3>A Modern UI with Workflow-Driven Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User-Validated Layouts:</strong> Simplified the interface by prioritizing user actions over
                    system data.</li>
                <li><strong>Terminology Alignment:</strong> Matched field labels and groupings to real-world workflows.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Design Documentation:</strong> Created principles and guidelines to ensure consistent
                    development across teams
                    — a precursor to <a href="case_designsystem.html" class="blue">the formal design system work</a> I
                    later led.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Used color, grouping, and alignment to reduce scanning effort and
                    improve usability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Impact:</h2>
            <h3>Quantifiable UX Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ <strong>80% reduction</strong> in onboarding and training time.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Improved task completion rates</strong> for core user flows (validated through internal
                    testing).</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Higher developer efficiency</strong> through reusable XAML controls and better design
                    documentation.</li>
                <li>✅ <strong>Contributed to acquisition value:</strong> The UI modernization and workflow improvements
                    were highlighted as strategic assets during ServiceLink's acquisition of DRI.</li>

                <h4>Before & After: Real-World UI Transformation</h4>
                <p>To reduce confusion and cognitive overload, I redesigned the Loss Mitigation Status screen. The
                    comparison below shows how I transitioned the interface from a cluttered Visual FoxPro layout to 
                    a clean, user-centered design with clear hierarchy and simplified task flow.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned & Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real Users Change Everything:</strong> Shadowing end users revealed issues our internal
                    stakeholders never mentioned.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency Reduces Friction:</strong> Design patterns and terminology reduced cognitive
                    load across screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation is Worth It:</strong> Developer-facing design notes accelerated and improved 
                    implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Design ≠ Decoration:</strong> Good UX is about solving real workflow problems, not just
                    making the UI pretty.</li>
                <li><strong>Systems Thinking Starts Early:</strong> Rincon's UI work helped shape my philosophy on
                    scalable design,
                    eventually leading to the enterprise-wide <a href="case_designsystem.html" class="blue">design
