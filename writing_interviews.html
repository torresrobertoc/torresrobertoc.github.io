        <p>Spoiler alert! Users tend to find solutions for problems in ways you didn't expect. And guess what? Sometimes they don't even use that one feature we thought was the best idea ever.</p>
        
        <p>Regardless of how good we think we are at making software, at some point we need to know how our users actually use the software that we build. To do that, we need to do research. A Contextual Interview is a form of research in which a researcher observes users in their natural work-environment. During a contextual interview session, the user is asked questions about their process and about any issues they might have while performing their everyday software tasks.</p>
        
        <p>Conducting contextual interviews is the best way to discover usability issues in our software and I believe if we conducted more unbiased, comprehensive contextual interviews we'd improve the quality and value of our software while reducing the potential for risk. That being said, conducting an unbiased, comprehensive research study is challenging. It boils down to your ability to minimize interactions with the user so you can observe them as if you weren't there. This may be difficult for people who like to actively pursue a goal because this activity is very passive. Your intention as a researcher shouldn't be to accomplish anything other than noting the user's actions and pain-points.</p>
        
        <p>So, to help in this endeavor, here are some tips that I've used to conduct interview research sessions that I hope will produce more helpful research findings:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><h3>Stay emotionally neutral / Avoid becoming defensive</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sometimes watching a user fumble through your software can be frustrating or leave you feeling incredulous. If this happens to you, keep your emotions in check. You don't want influence the user's actions by looking upset or getting frustrated yourself. Instead, make notes as to the actions the user is performing and tell yourself that you'll be revisiting the issue(s) later. This should give you the emotional distance you need to continue conducting the study.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Reserve judgement / Don't jump to conclusions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid making judgements about your users actions. Not only do you want to avoid influencing the user, but you want to avoid jumping to conclusions. If a user is doing something different than what you believe is intended, wait for the user to complete the task then ask about why they decided to approach their work in that manner. Hopefully you'll learn something about how they do their work that will need to a better software feature.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Avoid leading questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The point of this research is to observe the user in the most natural work-environment possible. If you ask questions that leads the user to a conclusion/action other than one that they would have reached on their own, you've biased the study and potentially made your findings unreliable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Be mindful of body language</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to notice if/when the user sighs, frowns, leans in, grumbles, etc. These are all indicators that the user might not be aware they're doing but are also clear signs that something in the software isn't as smooth as it can be. Please note that the users might not mention these moments of frustrations as problems, but our job is to find all the kinks and fix them.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I hope these tips help you with your UX research or at least expose you to UX research.</p>
