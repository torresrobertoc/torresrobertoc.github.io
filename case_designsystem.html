                <h4>TL;DR</h4>
                I led the transition from a Silverlight (XAML) UI to a modern, scalable HTML/CSS-based UI framework.
                To support this shift, I built an Atomic Design System that ensured enterprise-wide UI consistency, 
                reduced UI development time by 30%, and streamlined developer onboarding for the new Single-Page Architectures (SPA).

            <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
            <h3>Modernizing an Outdated UI Stack</h3>

            <h4>Context:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The LoanSphere (formerly Fusion/Rincon) platform was transitioning away from Silverlight/XAML to a modern tech stack.</li>
                <li>UI inconsistency was a major blocker—each team designed their own components, causing visual fragmentation and higher dev effort.</li>
                <li>Accessibility (WCAG compliance) was not prioritized.</li>
                <li>UI scalability was not planned, making the applications hard to maintain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Constraints:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Teams were implementing different frameworks (React, Angular), so the system needed to be technology-agnostic, ensuring long-term viability and widespread adoptability. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>My Role & Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>I played a foundational role in shaping the UI strategy for LoanSphere's transition to a modern stack, leveraging my expertise in UX, front-end development, and system design.</p>
            <ol class="h3">

                <li><h3>Architectural Collaboration &amp; Strategy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engaged with architects, developers, and leadership to determine the best approach for modernizing the UI.</li>
                        <li>Advised on UI framework options (React, Angular), helping transition from Silverlight (XAML) to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                        <li>Built a browser-rendered, scalable system to ensure adaptability across evolving technology stacks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Design System Development</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Established Atomic Design Principles to create consistent, reusable UI components.</li>
                        <li>Developed UI libraries using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, ensuring rapid implementation across projects.</li>
                        <li>Created a centralized documentation hub with developer notes and implementation guidelines.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Developer Support &amp; System Evangelism</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provided hands-on UI development support, guiding teams in adopting and implementing components.</li>
                        <li>Delivered training workshops and presented at virtual meetups to drive system adoption.</li>
                        <li>Maintained an iterative feedback loop, refining UI components based on real-world usage.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <h3>A Modular, Scalable Design System</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atomic Design Framework</strong> → Broke UI into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms, ensuring consistency & scalability.</li>
                <li><strong>Component Library</strong> → Built reusable UI elements (buttons, forms, navigation, layouts) for faster development.</li>
                <li><strong>Developer Notes & Documentation</strong> → Created clear implementation guides to ensure devs understood the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability & Flexibility</strong> → Designed for multiple applications & projects, reducing duplicate work.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance & Adoption</strong> → Established design principles & best practices for teams adopting the system.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Implementation in Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First implemented in LoanSphere Loss Mitigation UI, then expanded to Bankruptcy PCN (100% adoption).</li>
                <li>PCN became the first major implementation of the new design system UI components.</li>
                <li>The design system was battle-tested, proving its scalability, efficiency, and flexibility in real-world application development.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="component-example">
                <h3>Component in Action: <span class="italic">Tile</span></h3>
                <!-- <h3>Component in Action:</h3>
                <h4>"Tile" (Molecule)</h4> -->
                <p>To help streamline decision-making for loan specialists, I introduced a tile-based layout at the top of the Loss Mitigation interface. 
                    These tiles display critical borrower, loan, and property data at a glance—minimizing clicks and improving task flow.</p>

                    </div>

                <h4>Design Highlights:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reusable Molecule:</strong> Each tile is a modular UI component from the design system's Molecules tier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Scan-ability:</strong> Prioritized typography and grouping for quick visual parsing of key data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency Across Screens:</strong> These tiles became a design pattern adopted in other modules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Reduced decision-making time and improved UX consistency across workflows.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
